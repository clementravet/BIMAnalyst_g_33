# Assignment 5 - Reflection
## Our process of developing the tutorial
#### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
It was enable to help us answer the question we had for this course, although I think we have to answer it individually if we might need it later for thesis.
#### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
No we thought it was really good variety and we definetly found what we thought was interested
#### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
The structure together with the freedom worked out nicely and the tools were good.

## Learning experience on the concept we worked on
### Clément
#### Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
In the beginning of the course, I knew how to code in Python but I had no knowledge in BIM. At the end of the course, I improved myself in Python and I have now some knowledge in BIM.
#### What else do you still need to learn?
I still need to learn how to do BIM from scratch.
#### how you might use OpenBIM in the future?
I think that I might use OpenBIM in the future through tools to extract some data from BIM models to help me writing reports.
#### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
I do not really know for now what my thesis will be about so it is complicated to say. But as we can use OpenBIM to do a lot of different things, I might find a way to use it for my thesis. It will depend on which subject I decide to focus on.
#### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
As I said before, I OpenBIM has a lot of different purposes so I might have the opportunity to use it in the future in my professional life. Indeed, it is possible that I might create tools to extract data from BIM models to be faster to write reports or just do some calculations automaticaly.
#### conclude the journey through A1-A5
I am really happy with the work we did with the group. We found a way to work together on a subject we are all interested in. We decided to work on the DGNB certification and we then choosed a criteria based on the U_values. As for me, the BPMN diagram we did well describes the utility of the tool and when it has to be used. The tool in itself is not that complicated but it well does what we wanted at the beginning of the project. We are quite happy with it. It can still be improved by adding lines to export the data in an Excel file for instance. In the tool, we directly use U_values that are given in the psets, we can maybe add lines to calculate the U_values based on the type and the thickness of the material in case we do not have the U_value directly.


### Eiður 
#### Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended 
For me, my level in the beginning was Analyst, I have coded some before but had some hard time doing it. Now I would say that I'm self learner, I learned the knowledge to teach myself how to fix my problems or learn what is missing and need to do with my code.
#### What else do you still need to learn?
I need to be more confident in scripts and to know my next step and furthermore the understanding of other scripts when looking at them, I think that is important, when searching for help to know what I can use and what not to use. 
#### how you might use OpenBIM in the future?
Great question, I don't really know, but hopefully my knowlegde and experience now will help me in the future.
#### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
No I would say I'm not very likely to use OpenBIM in my thesis.
#### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Probably yes, I was not really familiar with it before taking this class but it would have been nice to have my knowlegde that I have now, few years back because I was working close with it, but because of my lack of knowlegde my input wasn't as much as I wanted it to be because of that. 
#### conclude the journey through A1-A5
I'm really happy with my journey throughout the Assignments. The assignment we chose, to work the the DGNB certification, was a good fit for us I think. In my opinion we did good job on describing the projects in the reports and the groupwork was good thoughout the entire semester. Our BPMN diagram is accurate and explaines the process of our tool, and it can be used through the whole process of building a building, mostly stages B, C and D, but there is no rule to now use it in A as well (Advanced Building Design). I wouldn't say our script is overly complicated and the tool is nice in use. For further development I would implicate a tool that automatically calculates the U-value in the materials. In our case it was already implimented in the IFC but if it wouldn't have been, it would be needed to identify the materials and find their thickness and then calculate the U-values. A good thought for future references.  

### Emma
#### Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended 
I have no experience in scripting or working with coding, but I have with modelling BIM. I would therefore say I started as a "modeller", but throughout the course I have developed into "BIM Analyst". I now understand how the information in BIM modelles are stored, and how to work with it. I am still not good at coding and scripting, but knowing how to find the information needed the scripting will come.
#### What else do you still need to learn?
I definately think the overall concept for coding is the biggest challange for me. I think this course would have given me more outcome if I knew the basics of coding beforehand - but having a group where other members where more experienced than me was very helpful.
#### how you might use OpenBIM in the future?
I definately think OpenBIM is very usefull in many aspects of the building enviroment. Gathering information from the modeles are very useful, and a gives a collective understanding of the building - especially when working with one model of course. The challange I see with using OpenBIM is, that it requires the actual modelling of the building to be highly accurate and information-rich, for it to be truly useful. Also that there are some common guidelines for modelling the model, so you know all modeles contains the required information. 
#### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
Since I don’t yet know the exact topic of my thesis, I can’t answer this definitively. However, if my thesis involves gathering information from a model, I would definitely consider using OpenBIM tools.
#### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
I already use OpenBIM in my current work, particularly for performing LCAs and DGNB certifications. In this context, I use programs like Solibri that work with IFC models. While I don’t write scripts like we have done in this course, I can see myself using such tools more frequently in the future. Personally, as someone without a coding background, I prefer software like Solibri because it allows me to focus on extracting quantities without needing advanced scripting for additional information.
#### conclude the journey through A1-A5
For me, the process thoughtout this course have been quite frustating. Having no experirence in coding or scripting, which is the whole core of this course, it is very difficult to make tools that are actually useful. I had great ideas for which tools could be made and be very useful in real-life-scenarios as well, but actually developing the tools and not being able to help alot with the coding-part, the process have been quite frustating at times. I will say, that it is very good having groups. It was great to collaborate with group members who had more experience with scripting, while I contributed with ideas for tools that could be practical in real-life situations. 
To conclude, the process has been rewarding overall, despite some natural frustrations along the way. I really enjoyed A4(teaching) and it was actually the part, that have given me the most. Teaching our tool to others and seeing the tools developed by others was both inspiring and helpful.
